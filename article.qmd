## What are the total number of languages? How many are Endangered? 


The World Economic Forum reports that there are around 7,000 recognized languages in existence, with African languages comprising one-third of this total. Interestingly, the majority of people worldwide communicate in just 20 languages. Additionally, a concerning statistic reveals that 40% of the world's languages are in danger of disappearing completely.

However, it's important to note that not all endangered languages face an equal risk of extinction. UNESCO has devised a classification system that assesses the vulnerability of languages, providing insights into their level of endangerment.

| Classification | Explanation |
|----------------|-------------|
| Vulnerable     |The language is commonly spoken by children, but its usage might be limited to specific areas or contexts. (ex: home, etc) |
| Definitely Endangered | Children no longer acquire the language as their first language within their family environment. |                
| Severely Endangered | The language is spoken by grandparents and older generations, and although parents may comprehend it, they do not actively use it when communicating with their children or among themselves. |         
| Critically Endangered | The language is spoken partially and infrequently by the youngest speakers, who are typically grandparents or older individuals. |            
| Extinct        | There are no remaining individuals who can speak the language.|



## World Record For Endangered Languages

Australia holds the global record for endangered languages when considering its population size. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, there were over 300 Indigenous languages spoken throughout the country. Sadly, one-third of these languages have already become extinct, and linguist experts warn that the remaining two-thirds are in a critically endangered state. Shockingly, only twelve out of the original 300 languages are currently being passed on to younger generations.

## Endangered Languages Risk Factors

In a recent study conducted by Australian National University researchers, it has been revealed that approximately 1,500 endangered languages worldwide face the risk of vanishing by the end of this century. The researchers were surprised to discover certain factors that contribute to the extinction of these languages. For instance, they found a correlation between the density of roads in specific countries and the heightened risk of language endangerment. It appears that the presence of extensive road networks facilitates the dominance of larger languages, overshadowing smaller ones.

Furthermore, the researchers identified years of schooling as another contributing factor to language extinction. As children progress through the education system, the endangerment of languages increases. This finding indicates that formal education can inadvertently contribute to the loss of linguistic diversity. To counterbalance the dominance of major languages taught in schools, the study emphasizes the significance of implementing bilingual courses as a means of preserving endangered languages.
